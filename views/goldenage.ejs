                <p>Another name for this era is "the Golden Age of Arcade Video 
                Games."</p>
                
                <p>This was a time when arcade video games entered pop culture 
                and became a dominant cultural phenominom.</p>
                
                <p>It lead to the rise of hits such as Pac-Man, Defender, 
                Donkey Kong, and Centipede.</p>
                
                <p>Besides arcades, this was also when the second generation of 
                consoles came out, which included platforms such as: Fairchild, 
                Channel F, Atari 2600, Intellivision, Odyssey, and ColecoVision.</p>
                
                <p>This was marked the beginning of PC Gaming as home computers 
                started appearing and hobbyist groups ported popular arcade games 
                such as Space Invaders and Frogger.</p>
